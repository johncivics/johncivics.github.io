  <h2>Background</h2>
  <ul>
    The treatment of cancer in Canada is based on wealth and socioeconomic status, allowing wealthy people to afford better medical equipment and to skip the line. People in poorer communities will get less access to cancer treatment and thus are more likely to die from cancer. This is concerning because 44% of Canadians will contract cancer during their lifetime, and cancer develops more frequently in poorer communities. Additionally, poorer communities usually lack doctors and treatment options. The mortality rate for a 5-year cancer is 27% in urban areas, but it is way higher at 39% in poorer areas. </ul>

    <ul>The government is unable to act due to economic issues, as taxes will have to be increased for this to happen. This NGO, Canadian Cancer Society, relies on mostly donations, sponsorships, and government grants. Although they can provide free medical equipment and treatment, they will not be able to solve the long-term problem.
  </ul>

  <h2>Perspectives and Power</h2>
  <ul>
   As the wage gaps increase, the more people are affected by this socioeconomic class difference. The people who are affected by this issue vastly outnumber the people who do not get affected. Political parties would advocate for the lower classes to gain influence. For example, if the lower class demand more equality, the parties should try their best to give them more equality because of electoral pressure. </ul>
  <img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294060.1571730710!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fedelxn-liberal-20190923.jpg?im=Resize%3D780" alt="Liberal Healthcare" height="300" width=600>
   <ul>This issue is about society, human rights, and how they are upheld. Everyone has a right to equal medical treatment of a disease, especially a potentially fatal one. However, the wealthy can afford to pay people to skip the line, while the poor lack medical equipment. This does not uphold everyone's rights to health equity.
  </ul>

  <ul>  The Liberals want to impose fines to people who skip the line, while the People's Party will hire more doctors and invest into more hospitals.

  <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
  <ul>
    Instead of providing more free treatment, the political parties are trying to make their services cheaper by hiring more doctors and generally investing more into the healthcare sector. However, The Canadian Cancer Society is working to provide free medical equipment and caregivers to cancer patients.

  <h2>Solutions</h2>
  <ul>
  Liberal Party's Solution:
  </ul>
  <ul>Fines the wealthy people who are trying to pay to skip the lines, however this only delays the problem</ul>
  <ul>Governments and political parties have the spending power and investment to try to make curing cancer and healthcare in general cheaper, faster, and more accessible (hiring doctors)</ul>
  <ul>‎ </ul>

  <ul>Solution 1:</ul>
  <ul>Build more hospitals and invest more into the medical field, hiring more doctors which makes healthcare cheaper and more accessible, especially to non-urban and poorer areas lacking doctors.</ul>
  <ul>‎ </ul>
      <img src="https://visit.parl.ca/staticfiles/Visit/assets/images2/img-box-east-block.jpg" height="250" width="500" alt="Healthcare improvement roadmap">
  <ul>Solution 2:</ul>
<ul>Combine the Canadian Cancer Society into the government, with citizen donations still being accepted for the NGO</ul>
<ul>This allows the NGO to act alongside the government, taking a cut of the taxes and using the increased funding to invest more into doctors, research, and hospitals to have a long-term impact</ul>
